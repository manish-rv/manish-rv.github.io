## Changes Made This Session

### 1. Consolidated Duplicate Code in index.html

#### Extracted `SectionHeading` component
- Heading rendering pattern was duplicated 4 times (About, Experience, Projects, Contact)
- Created shared `SectionHeading({ lines, style })` component
- Consolidates identical `h2` styling (font-display, fontSize clamp, letterSpacing)
- Contact passes custom style overrides for its larger heading

#### Extracted `LinkButton` component
- Primary/secondary button markup was duplicated in Hero and Contact
- Created shared `LinkButton({ href, label, primary, target, rel })` component
- Handles primary (filled) and secondary (outlined) button variants

#### Reused `SectionLabel` in Contact
- Contact section had inline markup duplicating the existing `SectionLabel` component
- Replaced with `<SectionLabel number={...} label={...}/>`

#### Consolidated footer meta spans in Contact
- Three identical `<span>` elements with same className mapped over array instead

### 2. Consolidated CSS Tag Classes (globals.css)
- `.skill-tag`, `.etag`, `.etag-w` shared ~90% identical CSS
- Extracted shared base rule: `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `letter-spacing`, `text-transform`, `padding`
- Each class now only defines its unique `border` and `color` values

### 3. Fixed Timeline Diamond Visibility in Light Mode
- Diamond border changed from `border-skin-ghost` → `border-skin-text`
- Diamond background changed from `bg-skin-muted` → `bg-skin-base`
- Now clearly visible in both dark and light themes

### 4. Modularized Components into Separate Files
- Split all React components out of `index.html` into `components/` directory
- `index.html` reduced from ~655 lines to ~115 lines
- Each component is loaded via `<script type="text/babel" src="...">` tags
- Load order: shared utilities → individual components → App root

#### New file structure:
```
components/
  shared.js       ← useReveal, useTimelineFill, SectionHeading, LinkButton, SectionLabel
  Cursor.js       ← Cursor component
  Particles.js    ← Particles canvas effect
  Nav.js          ← ThemeToggle, MobileMenu, Nav
  Hero.js         ← Hero section
  Marquee.js      ← Marquee ticker
  About.js        ← About section
  Experience.js   ← TimelineItem + Experience section
  Projects.js     ← ProjectCard + Projects section
  Contact.js      ← Contact section
```

### 5. Deleted Unused Standalone Files
- Removed 12 files that were earlier reference versions not used by the running app
- Data had diverged between `data/content.js` and the active `data/*.js` files
