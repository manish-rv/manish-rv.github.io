  bio: [
    `With over six years of experience as a Salesforce Engineer, I specialize in architecting scalable solutions for the finance and travel sectors. I have a proven track record of driving operational efficiency through high-impact technical initiatives, including the design of dynamic API integration frameworks and the engineering of cross-instance synchronizations that ensure data integrity. Most recently, I have pioneered AI-driven support ecosystems by deploying Salesforce Messaging for In-App and Web (MIAW) and leveraging Data Cloud and Agentforce to build autonomous, intelligent agents for internal knowledge management.`,
    `Outside of Salesforce, I work with AI tools to build full-stack apps, and I enjoy playing outdoor sports.`,
